1. PHP is a popular server-side scripting language primarily used for web development.
 It is especially suited for creating dynamic web pages and web applications.
 Generally speaking, serverside languages play a pivotal role in creating interactive and data-driven web applications by handling back-end logic, database operations,  and user management.

 2. PHP and Javascript are both similar in that they are considered scripting languages, they have a web development focus, they both have dynamic content generation and OOP features, and they both have extensive libraries that enhance the capabilities.
However, PHP runs on the server and Javascript runs in the client's browser. PHP is largely used for backend programming whereas Javascript is largely used for frontend.
In addition to this, PHP is often used to interact directly with databases on the server side, whereas javascript does not typically interact with databases directly; instead opting to use AJAX. Also, PHP is generally used for synchonous operations whereas Javascript is natively suited for asynchronous operations.

3. PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language known for its ease of learning and user-friendly syntax, making it accessible for beginners.
It boasts a large and active community that provides extensive resources, documentation, and support for developers.
It also integrates seamlessly into databases and offers robust frameworks that enhance useability.
 It is also supported by most web hosting providers, ensuring cost-effective deployment across various platforms.

 4. Both include and require are used to include files, but differ greatly in how they handle errors and missing files.
 With include, if the specified file cannot be found, PHP generates a warning and continues. With require, PHP generates a fatal error.
 include is typically used for files that are not critical to an applications functionality, whereas require is typically used for essential files.

 5. echo and var_dump are both PHP functions used for outputting data, but they serve 2 different purposes and provide different levels of detail.
 echo is primarily used for outputting strings or variables in the browser. It is a language construct rather than a function, meaning it does not require parentheses.
 var_dump is primarily used for debugging purposes, as it displays structured information(type/value) about one or more variables.
 echo only outputs the value of the variable or string provided, whereas var_dump outputs the data type and value.
