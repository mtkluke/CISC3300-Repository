1. PDOs are PHP Data Objects, a database access layer of PHP that provides a consistent inferace for accessing different types of databases

A DSN is a data source name, which is a string that defines the connection parameters for a database.
It is critical to creating a PDO instance and is used to specify the type of database, the host, database name, charset, and other variables.

2.  .env files are used to store environmental variables for a project. These variables typically contain sensitive/configurable information like API keys, database credentials, or other application settings.

A .gitignore file tells Git which directories to ignore in a Git repository. This is useful for excluding files that contain sensitive data/are irrelevant to the project.

3. No, you should never upload passwords of any kind to Github.

4. SQL Injection is a type of cyberattack where an attacker manipulates SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code into an application's input fields. 
The vulnerability occurs when user input is improperly handled and directly incorporated into SQL statements, allowing attackers to bypass authentication, access, modify, and delete data.

5. Prepared statments are a feature of database libraries that seperate the SQL query structure from user input, making them a secure and efficient way to execute queries.
In order to insert variables into a prepared statement, you can use positional placeholders(use ? as a placeholder for variables.)
