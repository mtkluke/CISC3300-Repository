1. The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents, representing the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects.
Each node within the tree represents a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or texts.
The DOM tree refers to this hierarchical structure, where elements are organized in a parent-child relationship, allowing scripts to access, modify, and interact with the content dynamically.

2. An XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, which are then executed in the user's browser to steal data or impersonate users.
These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that fail to properly sanitize or validate user input.
To defend against XSS, developers should sanitize inputs, escape special characters when displaying user-generated content, and implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to control what resources a browser can load.

3. An event is an action or occurence that the browser can trigger, such as a mouse click, button press, or page load.
They allow developers to write code to respond to these interactions, enabling dynamic behavior on a web page.

4. A DOM event listener works by "listening" for a specific event (like a click or key press) on a selected element, and then executing a function when that event occurs.
When using the addEventListener method, there are 3 expected parameters: An Event Type,A Callback Function, and a options object/boolean value.

5. jQuery is a fast, lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX interactions.
It acts as a simple API that works across many browsers, making DOM manipulation and event handling far more straightforward than vanilla javascript.
It's simple syntax and compatability makes it a very popular choice among developers for things like selecting elements, creating animations, and handling events.
To load jQuery, you can download and reference the jQuery library or use a <script> tag linking to a CDN-hosted version.
